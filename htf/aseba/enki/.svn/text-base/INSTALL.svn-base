Source distribution

This section explains how to compile libenki from the source distribution.

Prerequisites

To compile libenki and programs who depend on it, you need:
* a working and fairly recent c++ compiler, such as GCC [1]
* CMake [2]
* A build environment compatible with CMake.

Compilation

Those short instructions assume that you want to use "make" to build Enki [3].
If you want to use another build environment, such as Microsoft Visual Studio, please refer to cmake documentation [2].
Once you have downloaded and extracted the libenki source distribution, either from a released version or from SVN [4], you can create the Makefiles by running:
	cmake .
and then build Enki by running:
	make

You can also change the build options by running:
	ccmake .
prior to cmake.
