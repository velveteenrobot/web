To compile Dashel, you need CMake 2.6 or later (http://www.cmake.org/).
The CMake website provides documentation on how to use CMake on the different
platforms:
	http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html

If you are on Unix and lazy, and just want to compile Dashel without any
additional thinking, try the following commands in Dashel sources directory:
	cmake . && make
If this does not work, then read the aforementioned web page.

Optionally, on Linux, to enumerate serial ports properly, you can install libudev:
	libudev (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/libudev/)

If you still have some problem to compile Dashel after reading the relevant
documentation, feel free to post your question on our development mailing
list. You can subscribe to the latter at:
	http://gna.org/mail/?group=dashel

Enjoy Dashel!

	The developers
